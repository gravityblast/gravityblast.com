Some people in the past had problems using the <a href="http://github.com/gravityblast/radiant-gallery/tree/master">Gallery extension</a> on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>. I didn't try Dreamhost but someone from the Radiant list solved that problem following <a href="http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2009/01/02/ruby-187-upgrades/#comments">these instructions</a>. Check it out if you are on Dreamhost too.
