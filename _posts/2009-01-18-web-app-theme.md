A simple theme for web apps. <a href="http://github.com/gravityblast/web-app-theme/tree/master">Fork it on github</a> and use it for your cool applications!

<strong>[UPDATE]</strong>

Like I wrote in the comments, this layout is inspired from cool applications like <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">lighthouse</a>, <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">basecamp</a>, and others. I love those applications, I love their layouts, and it's difficult to not be inspired by them.
