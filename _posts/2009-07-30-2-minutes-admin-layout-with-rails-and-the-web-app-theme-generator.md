Many people found out a rails generator inside my <a href="http://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme">web-app-theme</a> project and asked me how to use it.
Here an example, starting from scratch with a new rails app that manages music Albums.

    rails cool_albums
    cd cool_albums
    script/generate scaffold Album name:string artist:string date:date
    rake db:migrate

After creating the first controller with a scaffold or with your hands, start creating a theme:

    script/plugin install git://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme.git
    script/generate theme application --app_name="My Cool Albums" --theme="drastic-dark"

The first argument ("application") is the name of the layout that the generator will create (application.html.erb).
The <strong>--app_name</strong> option specifies the name used as page title, and with the <strong>--theme</strong> specifies which theme to use among all the <a href="http://pilu.github.com/web-app-theme/" title="Web App Theme Demo">available themes</a> inside the plugin.

Now remove the default index.html created by rails and the layout created by the scaffold:

    rm app/views/layouts/albums.html.erb
    rm public/index.html

Add the following line in your <strong>routes.rb</strong> to set the default page of the application:

    map.root :controller => :albums

Start the server

    script/server

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/web-app-theme-example-1.jpg" />

Ok, the layout has been successfully created, but we need to apply a theme for each one of the views generated by the scaffold

    script/generate themed albums album --layout=application --with_will_paginate

With the first 2 arguments I specified the controller path (albums) and the model used (album).
The <strong>--layout</strong> options is used by the <strong>themed</strong> generator to know where to add the <strong>Albums</strong> menu link.

Since we want to use will paginate (we set the <strong>--with_will_paginate</strong> option), we need to change one line in our albums controller from:

    @albums = Album.all

to:

    @albums = Album.paginate(:per_page => 10, :page => params[:page])

Here a trick to show form error messages inside the auto generated forms, you can add the following lines in your <strong>environment.rb</strong>:

    ActionView::Base.field_error_proc = Proc.new do |html_tag, instance|
      if html_tag =~ /<label/
        %|<div class="fieldWithErrors">#{html_tag} <span class="error">#{[instance.error_message].join(', ')}</span></div>|
      else
        html_tag
      end
    end

Ok, restart your server and you are done.

Feel free to fork the project from <a href="http://github.com/pilu/web-app-theme/tree/master">github</a> to improve the generator or to add a new theme.
